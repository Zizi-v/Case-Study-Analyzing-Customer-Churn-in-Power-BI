## 📊 Dashboard Preview
![Churn Dashboard Overview](dashboard_screenshots/dashboard overview Image.png)
## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn directly impacts revenue stability and business growth.  
In this case study, I analysed a telecom customer dataset (Databel) to identify churn drivers, quantify revenue impact, and provide actionable retention strategies.

## 📂 Dataset Snapshot  
- 29 features  
- One row per customer  
- Includes demographics, contract details, usage behaviour, and billing information  
- Key variable: **Churn Label (Yes/No)**  

---

## 🔎 Analytical Approach  
- Data validation and quality checks  
- Churn rate calculation (Lost Customers / Total Customers)  
- Segmentation by:
  - Contract Type  
  - Age Group  
  - Payment Method  
  - Data Plan Type  
  - Account Length  
- Revenue impact analysis  
- Dashboard creation in Power BI

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Month-to-Month contracts** show significantly higher churn risk.  
- High frequency of **customer service calls** correlates with churn.  
- Customers without unlimited data plans are more price-sensitive and likely to churn.  
- Early-tenure customers present elevated churn probability.

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Target high-risk contract segments with retention incentives.  
- Proactively monitor customers with repeated service interactions.  
- Optimise pricing bundles for high-data users.  
- Implement onboarding engagement strategies for new customers.
